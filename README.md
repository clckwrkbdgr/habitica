habitica
========

Two tools for interacting with [Habitica](http://habitica.com):

1. Python wrapper for the RESTful Habitica API (`habitica.api`)
2. Command-line interface with subcommands (e.g. `> habitica todos`)

install
-------

`pip install habitica`.

I push to pip fairly frequently, but if you'd like to be on the bleeding edge,
clone this project and install it by hand:

    > git clone https://github.com/philadams/habitica
    > pip install -e habitica

configure
---------

You'll need to let the tool know how to connect to your Habitica account. To do
this, you'll need to add the following credentials section in the file
`~/.config/habitica/auth.cfg` (you may need to create the folder(s) and file):

    [Habitica]
    url = https://habitica.com
    login = USER_ID
    password = API_KEY

There's a template for this file at `auth.cfg.sample`.

Replace USER\_ID and API\_KEY with the corresponding tokens from [your Habitica
settings>API page](https://habitica.com/#/options/settings/api).

You can replace `url` as needed, for example if you're self-hosting a Habitica
server.

Lastly, remember to `chmod 600 ~/.config/habitica/auth.cfg` to keep your
credentials secret.

What's my character's status?

    > habitica status
    --------------
    Level 83 Rogue
    --------------
    Health: 50/50
    XP: 904/2690
    Mana: 133/218
    Pet: Gryphon-Base (11 food items)
    Mount: FlyingPig-Base

Show me my todo items:

    > habitica todos
    [ ]  1 update habitica README with example instructions
    [ ]  2 vacuum the car
    [ ]  3 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
    [ ]  4 order new contact lenses
    [ ]  5 complete Keppi project report and share with Geri
    [ ]  6 set up dinner with friends at Agava for Saturday night

Complete a todo:

    > habitica todos done 1
    marked todo 'update habitica README with example instructions' complete
    [ ] 1 vacuum the car
    [ ] 2 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"
    [ ] 3 order new contact lenses
    [ ] 4 complete Keppi project report and share with Geri
    [ ] 5 make reservation at Agava for Saturday night

Complete multiple todos. All `done`, `undo`, `up`, `down` commands can take 1
or more tasks as arguments, using either comma-separated lists or ranges or
both:

    > habitica todos done 1,3-5
    marked todo 'update habitica README with example instructions' complete
    marked todo 'vacuum the car' complete
    marked todo 'order new contact lenses' complete
    marked todo 'complete Keppi project report and share with Geri' complete
    marked todo 'make reservation at Agava for Saturday night' complete
    [ ] 1 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"

Add a new (hard!) todo. By default `--difficulty=easy`:

    > habitica todos add finish dissertation --difficulty=hard
    added new todo 'finish dissertation'
    [ ] 1 finish dissertation
    [ ] 2 read Bell and Jofish "Designing technology for domestic spaces"

Show me my habits, and how well I'm doing with each:

    > habitica habits
    [*******] 1 commit code
    [****] 2 drink water
    [******] 3 encourage others

Record improvement with some habits:

    > habitica habits up 2,3
    incremented task 'drink water'
    incremented task 'encourage others'
    [*******] 1 commit code
    [****] 2 drink water
    [******] 3 encourage others

Show me my dailies and each daily's state:

    > habitica dailies
    [ ] 1 pushups (5x20)
    [ ] 2 clean dishes before bed
    [x] 3 2x90mins writing

Complete a daily task:

    > habitica dailies done 1
    marked daily 'pushups (5x20)' completed
    [x] 1 pushups (5x20)
    [ ] 2 clean dishes before bed
    [x] 3 2x90mins writing

Is the Habitica server up?

    > habitica server
    Habitica server is up

help
----

Via `habitica --help`:

    Habitica command-line interface.

        Usage: habitica [--version] [--help]
                        <command> [<args>...] [--difficulty=<d>]
                        [--verbose | --debug]

        Options:
          -h --help         Show this screen
          --version         Show version
          --difficulty=<d>  (easy | medium | hard) [default: easy]
          --verbose         Show some logging information
          --debug           Some all logging information

        The habitica commands are:
          status                 Show HP, XP, GP, and more
          habits                 List habit tasks
          habits up <task-id>    Up (+) habit <task-id>
          habits down <task-id>  Down (-) habit <task-id>
          dailies                List daily tasks
          dailies done           Mark daily <task-id> complete
          dailies undo           Mark daily <task-id> incomplete
          todos                  List todo tasks
          todos done <task-id>   Mark one or more todo <task-id> completed
          todos add <task>       Add todo with description <task>
          server                 Show status of Habitica service
          home                   Open tasks page in default browser

        For `habits up|down`, `dailies done|undo`, and `todos done`, you can pass
        one or more <task-id> parameters, using either comma-separated lists or
        ranges or both. For example, `todos done 1,3,6-9,11`.
